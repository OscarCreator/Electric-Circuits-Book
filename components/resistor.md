# Resistor

A resistor is used to reduce flow in a circuit. The voltage drop over the resistor is proportional to the size of the resistor.

Ohm's law is used to calculate the resistance with the current (I) and the voltage (U)

## Memorize

Think the flow (speed of traffic) before the resistor as a motorway and the flow (speed of traffic) through the resistor as a small country road. If all the cars from the motorway drives in on the small country road, the speed of the traffic will slow down. This will reduce the **flow** through the resistor.
