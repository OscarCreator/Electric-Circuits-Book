# Resistor

A resistor is used to reduce flow in a circuit. The voltage drop (U) over the resistor is proportional to the size of the resistor. The current (I) into the resistor is the same as the current that goes out. The current goes from positive (+) to negative (-) pole.

Ohm's law is used to calculate the resistance with the current (I) and the voltage (U)

## Memorize

### Flow

Think the **flow** (speed of traffic) before the resistor as a motorway and the **flow**  through the resistor as a small country road. If all the cars from the motorway drives in on the small country road, the speed of the traffic will slow down. This will reduce the **flow** of the traffic.

### Voltage drop

Picture voltage as the **elevation** in a waterfall. If you start out at the top (before resistor) and then end at the bottom (after resistor) then the voltage drop is the **elevation loss** from top to bottom.
