# Resistor

A resistor is used to reduce flow in a circuit. The voltage drop over the resistor is proportional to the size of the resistor.

Ohm's law is used to calculate the resistance with the current \(I\) and the voltage \(U\)

## Memorize

Think the flow \(speed of traffic\) before the resistor as a motorway and the flow \(speed of traffic\) through the resistor as a small country road. If all the cars from the motorway drives in on the small country road, the speed of the traffic will slow down. This will reduce the **flow** through the resistor.
